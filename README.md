# Jmpyyn Engine
I used this to look at memory and for debugging. No idea if writing works on any eac protected game, but reading did! I followed [this tutorial](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/504191-undetected-cheat-engine-driver-2022-bypass-anticheats-eac.html) and used [KDU](https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU) to toggle dse (driver signature enforcement) during runtime. This is project is nearly a year old, do not expect it to work at all.
